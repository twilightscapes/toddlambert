Meant to be a dynamic header image that shows the car in a multitude of different scenes. I also programatically change the css tint, so that the car changes to different colors depending on the background.

This is a VidSocks example of blending animated SVGs, and graphics over a full-screen video background.

Works on all devices and screen sizes.
